# 2ch-midi-to-arduino

This script does require a precondition
You'll need mf2txp from midiox (giyf), place mf2txp.exe in same directory as the script
and then execute this script.

Also it is only supported to run "2-track"-midi-files
This concludes to, that you'll need 2 arduinos for that


i also do recommend watching into Musescore (also google it), which helped me alot for certain "tasks" and specific entries

Feel free to ask questions in issues :wink:
